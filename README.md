# Project-4-Deals

##Concept

This idea originally came to me around Black Friday and Cyber Monday(week). Around this time of year, people go insane trying to get a "great deal" on ${insert_products_here}. In fact, it's to point that people camp out in the freezing cold away from their families on Thanksgiving, just to trample and physically beat other shoppers, just so that they can save a few bucks on said items. OK, it may not be that bad anymore, but there's not doubt that the deals are the best this time of year... right? Now, what if I told you that, there are great deals on your favorite products throughout the entire year. With my project, all you'll have to do is build your wishlist, then when your products go on sale, we'll let you know.

##User Story

When the user visits the page, they will see a list of popular products to search through. This will allow the users to get a feel for what products they can search for on the application. As of right now, the product search is powered by eBay so the list of products should be substantial. If the user is not signed in, then they will not be able to search for specific items. They are limited only to the popular products on the first page. If the user is happy with the search they will be able to click the sign-up button, and the sign-up modal will accept the user's credentials. There the user is free to search any product they want and save them to their wishlist.

##Under Construction

- Using Product API : Unfortunately I was unable to go with my orginal plan of using the ebay api to searh products. This is due to how the information is displayed using a backend fetch call. 
- Finding Daily Deal API : I reached out to several companies regarding the use of their APIs, but have not heard back from any yet. The moment that happens I intend to implement them. 
- User Authorization : Currently buidling, was unable to finish before current deadline
